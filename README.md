# Sales Performance Insights

## **Project Overview**
As a Data Analyst for a retail business, I was tasked with developing interactive dashboards to analyze sales and customer performance. The project covers data from **2020 to 2023** and utilizes **Microsoft Excel and Tableau** to transform raw sales and customer data into actionable insights. The goal was to provide the executive team with a dynamic view of key business metrics, enabling data-driven decision-making.

The analysis focuses on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, profitability, and customer order patterns. The Sales Dashboard tracks year-over-year trends, product performance, and weekly sales fluctuations, while the Customer Dashboard provides insights into customer behavior, segmentation, and top customers. Interactive filters allow users to explore trends dynamically across different years, regions, and product categories.

An interactive Tableau dashboard used to report and explore sales trends can be found here [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/premith.pradeep/viz/SalesCustomerDashboard_17410032820490/SalesDashboard).

## **Data Structure & Dataset Description**

The main database structure as seen below consists of four tables: customers, location, orders, products. A description of each table is as follows

- **Customers Dataset:** contains customer details (ID, name) for behavior analysis and segmentation.

- **Location Dataset:** contains details of region, state, and city data to analyze sales distribution.

- **Orders Dataset:** contains transaction details (order ID, date, product, sales, profit, quantity) for sales and profitability insights.

- **Products Dataset:** contains product details (ID, category, subcategory, name) to evaluate product performance.

## **Executive Summary**  

This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the companyâ€™s sales trends, profitability, and customer engagement from 2020 to 2023. Total sales reached $733K, reflecting a 20.4% YoY growth, with profit increasing by 14.2% to $93K. Sales consistently peak in Q4 (November-December), while February records the lowest sales each year.

In 2023, Week 48 had the highest weekly sales ($36K), while Week 21 saw the lowest ($4.36K). Copiers and Accessories emerged as the most profitable subcategories, whereas Tables remained a loss-making category across all years. Regionally, Chairs and Phones dominated most markets, except in the Western region, where Copiers and Binders were the top-selling subcategories.
